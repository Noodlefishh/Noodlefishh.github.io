Hi, my name is Jonathan. I go by Noodlefishh online. I have been working in IT for over 13 years and in cybersecurity for over 6 years. I was recently involved in AppSec and the security of the software supply chain (ie. DevSecOps, CI/CD, Containers, Dependency, Library, etc.). I was so hooked by the topic that i started paying a lot of attention to this field. 

In this day and age, all applications and infrastructure that we rely on every day, rely itself on so many dependencies and third parties. The old ways of doing things are over and we need to start looking forwards and way up ahead. This shift in the market did not go unnoticed by attackers. The sheer complexity of DevSecOps and "as code" environement makes it a perfect hunting ground for attackers. Organization lack the overall understanding of what they are deploying and what their core business application rely on. So TTPs have evolved this ways and so many oportunities are now open for attackers and APT to exploit, destroy and/or extort their victims. 

If this kind of stuff turns you on, i write about this. If you enjoy it, fine ! If you learn something, better !  Let's make DevSecOps and "As Code" environment easy to understand and let's bring awereness on this new hunting ground to better secure #1 - everyone personnal data and #2 - organization.

Welcome and happy that you stumble upon this small blog somewhere on a corner of the internet.
