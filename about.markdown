Hi, my name is Jonathan. I go by Noodlefishh online. I have been working in IT for over 13 years and in cybersecurity for over 6 years. I was recently involved in AppSec and the security of the software supply chain (ie. DevSecOps, CI/CD, Containers, Dependency, Library, etc.). I was so hooked by the topic that i started paying a lot of attention to this field. 

In this day and age, all applications and infrastructure that we rely on every day, rely itself on so many dependencies and third parties. The old ways of doing things are over and we need to start looking forwards and way up ahead. This shift in the market did not go unnoticed by attackers, so did their TTPs. 

I write about this stuff, if you enjoy it, fine ! If you learn something, also fine! 

Welcome and happy that you stumble upon this small blog somewhere on a corner on the internet.
