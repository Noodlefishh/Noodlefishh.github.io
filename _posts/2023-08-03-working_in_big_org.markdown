There are some great benefits working in a well-known organization. First of all, you got great salary (most of the time), second of all, you got a good amount of time off to go on vacation and enjoy time with the family, and finally, you got the stability that comes with that kind of job. I can clearly see why this kind of business looks attractive to younger talent or to people just getting their feet into the industry. I myself, am guilty of the sin of joining a multi-billion dollar corporation. 

# The Honeymoon Phase
The first day i got the call telling me i had the job, i was very pumped. Getting to work on very big project, making an impact on the lives of many people and adding layer by layer of security on what was going to be made available to so many people, employee and colleague. The work you do make sense and the value you add to the business is not noticeable. On paper, for any cyber pro, this seems like a dream jobs. The one you are stocked about and can't stop talking about.
