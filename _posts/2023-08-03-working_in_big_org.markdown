There are some great benefits working in a well-known organization. First of all, you got great salary (most of the time), second of all, you got a good amount of time off to go on vacation and enjoy time with the family, and finally, you got the stability that comes with that kind of job. I can clearly see why this kind of business looks attractive to younger talent or to people just getting their feet into the industry. I, myself, am guilty of the sin of joining a multi-billion dollar corporation.
